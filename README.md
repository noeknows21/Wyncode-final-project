# Tremo

Final Trio Project for Wyncode

Team- Noe Cordovez, Sean Gilchrist, Tommy Bisi

Tremo is a B2B web app that helps businesses amp up the quality of their customer service. It provides real time video chatting between customer service representatives and customers. It also provides emotion analysis of customers during the call. This gives managers the ability to see how well their representatives are handling customer calls and makes it much easier to discover and remedy any areas that need improvement. Tremo also provides the ability for employees to communicate internally via private sessions. This can be used to streamline communications between managers and representatives.

We have taken the demo website down. However, you can see our main features in action by viewing our demo screencast at https://vimeo.com/159995987
